Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the data's distribution and relationships.
Data Split: Divide the Iris dataset into separate training and testing portions.
Model Training: Develop a Logistic Regression model using the training data to predict Iris species.
Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix): Assess the model's performance on the testing data using a confusion matrix.
Metric Calculation: Compute Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score based on the confusion matrix.
Interpretation and Improvement: Explain the confusion matrix's insights and suggest strategies for enhancing prediction accuracy.

Split data, train a Logistic Regression model, evaluate with a confusion matrix and metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and explain/suggest improvements.
